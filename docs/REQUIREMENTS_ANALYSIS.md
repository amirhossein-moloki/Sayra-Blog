# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - Playnest

## 1. Executive Summary & Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Name
**Playnest** (پلتفرم مدیریت و رزرو گیم‌نت)

### 1.2 Project Vision
To provide a robust, intelligent, and scalable platform for gaming center management and reservations, empowering owners with operational efficiency and gamers with seamless booking experiences.

### 1.3 Project Goals
*   **Automation:** Streamline the reservation process for both online and walk-in customers.
*   **Real-time Control:** Provide a live dashboard for monitoring station status and occupancy.
*   **Financial Integrity:** Ensure accurate tracking of revenue, commissions, and customer balances.
*   **Customer Retention:** Build loyalty through membership tiers and a virtual wallet system.
*   **Online Presence:** Enable centers to have professional, SEO-optimized public websites via an integrated CMS.

### 1.4 Business Value
Playnest reduces overhead costs by automating staff tasks, minimizes revenue loss from booking overlaps or no-shows, and increases customer lifetime value through targeted loyalty features.

### 1.5 Problem Statement
Many gaming centers currently rely on manual or fragmented systems for managing bookings, staff, and finances. This leads to:
*   Booking overlaps and customer dissatisfaction.
*   Inefficient utilization of high-cost hardware (PC/Console/VR).
*   Difficulties in tracking financial performance and staff shifts.
*   Lack of a professional online presence for direct customer engagement.

### 1.6 Proposed Solution
A centralized, multi-tenant Express/TypeScript platform using Prisma and PostgreSQL. The solution includes:
*   A high-performance Booking Engine with overlap prevention.
*   Station Management for varied equipment types (PC, PS5, Xbox, VR).
*   Integrated CMS for site building and SEO.
*   Financial modules including Wallet, Zarinpal payment integration, and Commission tracking.

### 1.7 Success Criteria
*   **Zero Booking Overlaps:** 100% accuracy in reservation scheduling.
*   **Performance:** API response times under 200ms for critical operations.
*   **Scalability:** Support for multiple gaming centers (tenants) with isolated data.
*   **Usability:** High adoption rate by staff and positive feedback from end-customers.
